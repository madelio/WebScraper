# WebScraper

This project contains 3 branches: 
1. (web-scraper-script)[https://github.com/madelio/WebScraper/tree/web-scraper-script/WebScraperScript]:
	- This branch contains a script that saves 3 hardcoded urls into html files
2. (web-scraper-api)[https://github.com/madelio/WebScraper/tree/web-scraper-api/WebScraperScript/WebScraper]:
	- This branch builds onto the previous step and creates an API which takes in an encoded url string as it's input and outputs its html content
3. (web-scraper)[https://github.com/madelio/WebScraper/tree/web-scraper/web-extractor]:
	 - This builds onto the 2 previous steps and creates an EmberJS app as an interface for a user to enter any list of urls and output those results onto the interface
	 - This requires running both the API and UI projects to work 

All code has been merged into the `main` branch. Details on how run each step is inside of the respective folders' README pages.
