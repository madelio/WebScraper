# WebScraper

This project contains 3 branches: 
1. web-scraper-script:
	- this branch contains a script that saves 3 hardcoded urls into html files
2. web-scraper-api:
	- this branch builds onto the previous step and creates an API which takes in an encoded url string as it's input and outputs its html content
3. web-scraper-ui:
	 - this builds onto the 2 previous steps and creates an EmberJS app as an interface for a user to enter any list of urls and output those results onto the interface
