<div align="justify"><p>There are lots of ways to create web pages using already coded programmes. These lessons will teach you how to use the underlying HyperText Markup Language -  HTML. 
<br>
<p>HTML isn't computer code, but is a language that uses US English to enable texts (words, images, sounds) to be inserted and formatting such as colo(u)r and centre/ering to be written in. The process is fairly simple; the main difficulties often lie in small mistakes - if you slip up while word processing your reader may pick up your typos, but the page will still be legible. However, if your HTML is inaccurate the page may not appear - writing web pages is, at the least, very good practice for proof reading!</p>

<p>Learning HTML will enable you to:
<ul>
<li>create your own simple pages
<li>read and appreciate pages created by others
<li>develop an understanding of the creative and literary implications of web-texts
<li>have the confidence to branch out into more complex web design 
</li></ul>

<p>A HTML web page is made up of tags. Tags are placed in brackets like this <b>< tag > </b>. A tag tells the browser how to display information. Most tags need to be opened < tag > and closed < /tag >.

<p> To make a simple web page you need to know only four tags:
<ul>
<li>< HTML > tells the browser your page is written in HTML format
<li>< HEAD > this is a kind of preface of vital information that doesn't appear on the screen. 
<li>< TITLE >Write the title of the web page here - this is the information that viewers see on the upper bar of their screen. (I've given this page the title 'webpage1').
<li>< BODY >This is where you put the content of your page, the words and pictures that people read on the screen. 
</li></ul>
<p>All these tags need to be closed.

<h4>EXERCISE</h4>

<p>Write a simple web page.</p>
<p> Copy out exactly the HTML below, using a WP program such as Notepad.<br>
Information in <i>italics</i> indicates where you can insert your own text, other information is HTML and needs to be exact. However, make sure there are no spaces between the tag brackets and the text inside.<br>
(Find Notepad by going to the START menu\ PROGRAMS\ ACCESSORIES\ NOTEPAD). 
<p>
< HTML ><br>
< HEAD ><br>
< TITLE ><i> title of page</i>< /TITLE ><br>
< /HEAD ><br>
< BODY><br>
<i> write what you like here: 'my first web page', or a piece about what you are reading, or a few thoughts on the course, or copy out a few words from a book or cornflake packet.  Just type in your words using no extras such as bold, or italics, as these have special HTML tags, although you may use upper and lower case letters and single spaces. </i><br>

< /BODY ><br>
< /HTML ><br>

<p>Save the file as 'first.html' (ie. call the file anything at all) It's useful if you start a folder - just as you would for word-processing - and call it something like WEBPAGES, and put your first.html file in the folder.

<p>NOW - open your browser.<br>
On Netscape the process is: <br>  
Top menu; FILE\ OPEN PAGE\ CHOOSE FILE<br> 
Click on your WEBPAGES folder\ FIRST file<br>
Click 'open' and your page should appear.
<p>On Internet Explorer: <br>
Top menu; FILE\ OPEN\ BROWSE <br> 
Click on your WEBPAGES folder\ FIRST file<br>
Click 'open' and your page should appear.<br>


<p>If the page doesn't open, go back over your notepad typing and make sure that all the HTML tags are correct. Check there are no spaces between tags and internal text; check that all tags are closed; check that you haven't written < HTLM > or < BDDY >.  Your page will work eventually. 
<p>
Make another page. Call it somethingdifferent.html and place it in the same WEBPAGES folder as detailed above.

There are lots of ways to create web pages using already coded programmes. These lessons will teach you how to use the underlying HyperText Markup Language -  HTML. 




HTML isn't computer code, but is a language that uses US English to enable texts (words, images, sounds) to be inserted and formatting such as colo(u)r and centre/ering to be written in. The process is fairly simple; the main difficulties often lie in small mistakes - if you slip up while word processing your reader may pick up your typos, but the page will still be legible. However, if your HTML is inaccurate the page may not appear - writing web pages is, at the least, very good practice for proof reading!

<p>The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.</p>

<p>This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).</p>

<p>To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure. This has an <code>int16</code><sup>1)</sup> member called <code>Subsystem</code>. The member's value is 2 for a Windows application and 3 for a console application. Other subsystems exist (in particular, POSIX and kernel).
I've written a small VB6 application to change the subsystem of an application, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activevb.de/cgi-bin/upload/download.pl?id=2436" rel="noreferrer">ActiveVB</a> as source code.</p>

<p>The PE format isn't very well documented but this document may serve as an introduction: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ms809762.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1)</sup> This doesn't really contradict my claim that only one byte differs: the most significant byte of this member is always 0. Only the least significant byte changes.</p>

<p>Besides the difference mentioned by Konrad, console and Windows applications behave differently when called interactively from the command prompt:</p>

<p>When you start a console application, the command prompt doesn't return until the console application exits.
When you start a windows application, the command returns immediately.</p>

<p>This is not true for batch files; they will always wait until the application exits. (You can always use the <code>start</code> command to start an application without waiting.) </p>

<p>The difference is in the way the apps are stubbed out. When you use the console template, you have a stub that will fire up in a console. If you are already running in a console, it ignores the call to spin one up.</p>

<p>By the same token, a windows app is designed with a default form. If you want to clear it out, you can create a formless Windows Forms application that is essentially a console application without a console window.</p>

<p>As far as the guts of the app goes, they are essentially the same. The major difference is added on at the compile stage.</p>

<p>That is not to say that the techniques are otherwise mutually exclusive. Console applications can still use the whole gamut of Win32 API, and desktop ones can use console I/O (but they have to explicitly create a console window first).</p>

<p>The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.</p>

<p>This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).</p>

<p>To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure. This has an <code>int16</code><sup>1)</sup> member called <code>Subsystem</code>. The member's value is 2 for a Windows application and 3 for a console application. Other subsystems exist (in particular, POSIX and kernel).
I've written a small VB6 application to change the subsystem of an application, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activevb.de/cgi-bin/upload/download.pl?id=2436" rel="noreferrer">ActiveVB</a> as source code.</p>

<p>The PE format isn't very well documented but this document may serve as an introduction: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ms809762.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1)</sup> This doesn't really contradict my claim that only one byte differs: the most significant byte of this member is always 0. Only the least significant byte changes.</p>

<p>Besides the difference mentioned by Konrad, console and Windows applications behave differently when called interactively from the command prompt:</p>

<p>When you start a console application, the command prompt doesn't return until the console application exits.
When you start a windows application, the command returns immediately.</p>

<p>This is not true for batch files; they will always wait until the application exits. (You can always use the <code>start</code> command to start an application without waiting.) </p>

<p>The difference is in the way the apps are stubbed out. When you use the console template, you have a stub that will fire up in a console. If you are already running in a console, it ignores the call to spin one up.</p>

<p>By the same token, a windows app is designed with a default form. If you want to clear it out, you can create a formless Windows Forms application that is essentially a console application without a console window.</p>

<p>As far as the guts of the app goes, they are essentially the same. The major difference is added on at the compile stage.</p>

<p>The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.</p>

<p>This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).</p>

<p>To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure. This has an <code>int16</code><sup>1)</sup> member called <code>Subsystem</code>. The member's value is 2 for a Windows application and 3 for a console application. Other subsystems exist (in particular, POSIX and kernel).
I've written a small VB6 application to change the subsystem of an application, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activevb.de/cgi-bin/upload/download.pl?id=2436" rel="noreferrer">ActiveVB</a> as source code.</p>

<p>The PE format isn't very well documented but this document may serve as an introduction: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ms809762.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1)</sup> This doesn't really contradict my claim that only one byte differs: the most significant byte of this member is always 0. Only the least significant byte changes.</p>

<p>Besides the difference mentioned by Konrad, console and Windows applications behave differently when called interactively from the command prompt:</p>

<p>When you start a console application, the command prompt doesn't return until the console application exits.
When you start a windows application, the command returns immediately.</p>

<p>This is not true for batch files; they will always wait until the application exits. (You can always use the <code>start</code> command to start an application without waiting.) </p>

<p>The difference is in the way the apps are stubbed out. When you use the console template, you have a stub that will fire up in a console. If you are already running in a console, it ignores the call to spin one up.</p>

<p>By the same token, a windows app is designed with a default form. If you want to clear it out, you can create a formless Windows Forms application that is essentially a console application without a console window.</p>

<p>As far as the guts of the app goes, they are essentially the same. The major difference is added on at the compile stage.</p>

<p>That is not to say that the techniques are otherwise mutually exclusive. Console applications can still use the whole gamut of Win32 API, and desktop ones can use console I/O (but they have to explicitly create a console window first).</p>

<p>The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.</p>

<p>This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).</p>

<p>To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure. This has an <code>int16</code><sup>1)</sup> member called <code>Subsystem</code>. The member's value is 2 for a Windows application and 3 for a console application. Other subsystems exist (in particular, POSIX and kernel).
I've written a small VB6 application to change the subsystem of an application, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activevb.de/cgi-bin/upload/download.pl?id=2436" rel="noreferrer">ActiveVB</a> as source code.</p>

<p>The PE format isn't very well documented but this document may serve as an introduction: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ms809762.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1)</sup> This doesn't really contradict my claim that only one byte differs: the most significant byte of this member is always 0. Only the least significant byte changes.</p>

<p>Besides the difference mentioned by Konrad, console and Windows applications behave differently when called interactively from the command prompt:</p>

<p>When you start a console application, the command prompt doesn't return until the console application exits.
When you start a windows application, the command returns immediately.</p>

<p>This is not true for batch files; they will always wait until the application exits. (You can always use the <code>start</code> command to start an application without waiting.) </p>

<p>The difference is in the way the apps are stubbed out. When you use the console template, you have a stub that will fire up in a console. If you are already running in a console, it ignores the call to spin one up.</p>

<p>By the same token, a windows app is designed with a default form. If you want to clear it out, you can create a formless Windows Forms application that is essentially a console application without a console window.</p>

<p>As far as the guts of the app goes, they are essentially the same. The major difference is added on at the compile stage.</p>

<p>The entry point of console applications is <code>wmain</code> (since Visual studio 2008 IIRC), <code>main</code> if you opt out of Unicode-by-default. For desktop ones, it's <code>wWinMain</code>/<code>WinMain</code>.</p>

<p>That is not to say that the techniques are otherwise mutually exclusive. Console applications can still use the whole gamut of Win32 API, and desktop ones can use console I/O (but they have to explicitly create a console window first).</p>

<p>The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.</p>

<p>This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).</p>

<p>To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure. This has an <code>int16</code><sup>1)</sup> member called <code>Subsystem</code>. The member's value is 2 for a Windows application and 3 for a console application. Other subsystems exist (in particular, POSIX and kernel).
I've written a small VB6 application to change the subsystem of an application, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activevb.de/cgi-bin/upload/download.pl?id=2436" rel="noreferrer">ActiveVB</a> as source code.</p>

<p>The PE format isn't very well documented but this document may serve as an introduction: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ms809762.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1)</sup> This doesn't really contradict my claim that only one byte differs: the most significant byte of this member is always 0. Only the least significant byte changes.</p>

<p>Besides the difference mentioned by Konrad, console and Windows applications behave differently when called interactively from the command prompt:</p>

<p>When you start a console application, the command prompt doesn't return until the console application exits.
When you start a windows application, the command returns immediately.</p>

<p>This is not true for batch files; they will always wait until the application exits. (You can always use the <code>start</code> command to start an application without waiting.) </p>

<p>The difference is in the way the apps are stubbed out. When you use the console template, you have a stub that will fire up in a console. If you are already running in a console, it ignores the call to spin one up.</p>

<p>By the same token, a windows app is designed with a default form. If you want to clear it out, you can create a formless Windows Forms application that is essentially a console application without a console window.</p>

<p>As far as the guts of the app goes, they are essentially the same. The major difference is added on at the compile stage.</p>

<p>The entry point of console applications is <code>wmain</code> (since Visual studio 2008 IIRC), <code>main</code> if you opt out of Unicode-by-default. For desktop ones, it's <code>wWinMain</code>/<code>WinMain</code>.</p>

<p>That is not to say that the techniques are otherwise mutually exclusive. Console applications can still use the whole gamut of Win32 API, and desktop ones can use console I/O (but they have to explicitly create a console window first).</p>

<p>The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.</p>

<p>This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).</p>

<p>To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure. This has an <code>int16</code><sup>1)</sup> member called <code>Subsystem</code>. The member's value is 2 for a Windows application and 3 for a console application. Other subsystems exist (in particular, POSIX and kernel).
I've written a small VB6 application to change the subsystem of an application, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activevb.de/cgi-bin/upload/download.pl?id=2436" rel="noreferrer">ActiveVB</a> as source code.</p>

<p>The PE format isn't very well documented but this document may serve as an introduction: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ms809762.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1)</sup> This doesn't really contradict my claim that only one byte differs: the most significant byte of this member is always 0. Only the least significant byte changes.</p>

<p>Besides the difference mentioned by Konrad, console and Windows applications behave differently when called interactively from the command prompt:</p>

<p>When you start a console application, the command prompt doesn't return until the console application exits.
When you start a windows application, the command returns immediately.</p>

<p>This is not true for batch files; they will always wait until the application exits. (You can always use the <code>start</code> command to start an application without waiting.) </p>

<p>The difference is in the way the apps are stubbed out. When you use the console template, you have a stub that will fire up in a console. If you are already running in a console, it ignores the call to spin one up.</p>

<p>By the same token, a windows app is designed with a default form. If you want to clear it out, you can create a formless Windows Forms application that is essentially a console application without a console window.</p>

<p>As far as the guts of the app goes, they are essentially the same. The major difference is added on at the compile stage.</p>

<p>The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.</p>

<p>This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).</p>

<p>To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure. This has an <code>int16</code><sup>1)</sup> member called <code>Subsystem</code>. The member's value is 2 for a Windows application and 3 for a console application. Other subsystems exist (in particular, POSIX and kernel).
I've written a small VB6 application to change the subsystem of an application, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activevb.de/cgi-bin/upload/download.pl?id=2436" rel="noreferrer">ActiveVB</a> as source code.</p>

<p>The PE format isn't very well documented but this document may serve as an introduction: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ms809762.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1)</sup> This doesn't really contradict my claim that only one byte differs: the most significant byte of this member is always 0. Only the least significant byte changes.</p>

<p>Besides the difference mentioned by Konrad, console and Windows applications behave differently when called interactively from the command prompt:</p>

<p>When you start a console application, the command prompt doesn't return until the console application exits.
When you start a windows application, the command returns immediately.</p>

<p>This is not true for batch files; they will always wait until the application exits. (You can always use the <code>start</code> command to start an application without waiting.) </p>

<p>The difference is in the way the apps are stubbed out. When you use the console template, you have a stub that will fire up in a console. If you are already running in a console, it ignores the call to spin one up.</p>

<p>By the same token, a windows app is designed with a default form. If you want to clear it out, you can create a formless Windows Forms application that is essentially a console application without a console window.</p>

<p>As far as the guts of the app goes, they are essentially the same. The major difference is added on at the compile stage.</p>

<p>That is not to say that the techniques are otherwise mutually exclusive. Console applications can still use the whole gamut of Win32 API, and desktop ones can use console I/O (but they have to explicitly create a console window first).</p>

<p>The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.</p>

<p>This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).</p>

<p>To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure. This has an <code>int16</code><sup>1)</sup> member called <code>Subsystem</code>. The member's value is 2 for a Windows application and 3 for a console application. Other subsystems exist (in particular, POSIX and kernel).
I've written a small VB6 application to change the subsystem of an application, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activevb.de/cgi-bin/upload/download.pl?id=2436" rel="noreferrer">ActiveVB</a> as source code.</p>

<p>The PE format isn't very well documented but this document may serve as an introduction: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ms809762.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1)</sup> This doesn't really contradict my claim that only one byte differs: the most significant byte of this member is always 0. Only the least significant byte changes.</p>

<p>Besides the difference mentioned by Konrad, console and Windows applications behave differently when called interactively from the command prompt:</p>

<p>When you start a console application, the command prompt doesn't return until the console application exits.
When you start a windows application, the command returns immediately.</p>

<p>This is not true for batch files; they will always wait until the application exits. (You can always use the <code>start</code> command to start an application without waiting.) </p>

<p>The difference is in the way the apps are stubbed out. When you use the console template, you have a stub that will fire up in a console. If you are already running in a console, it ignores the call to spin one up.</p>

<p>By the same token, a windows app is designed with a default form. If you want to clear it out, you can create a formless Windows Forms application that is essentially a console application without a console window.</p>

<p>As far as the guts of the app goes, they are essentially the same. The major difference is added on at the compile stage.</p>

<p>The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.</p>

<p>This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).</p>

<p>To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure. This has an <code>int16</code><sup>1)</sup> member called <code>Subsystem</code>. The member's value is 2 for a Windows application and 3 for a console application. Other subsystems exist (in particular, POSIX and kernel).
I've written a small VB6 application to change the subsystem of an application, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activevb.de/cgi-bin/upload/download.pl?id=2436" rel="noreferrer">ActiveVB</a> as source code.</p>

<p>The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.</p>

<p>This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).</p>

<p>To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure. This has an <code>int16</code><sup>1)</sup> member called <code>Subsystem</code>. The member's value is 2 for a Windows application and 3 for a console application. Other subsystems exist (in particular, POSIX and kernel).
I've written a small VB6 application to change the subsystem of an application, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activevb.de/cgi-bin/upload/download.pl?id=2436" rel="noreferrer">ActiveVB</a> as source code.</p>

<p>The PE format isn't very well documented but this document may serve as an introduction: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ms809762.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1)</sup> This doesn't really contradict my claim that only one byte differs: the most significant byte of this member is always 0. Only the least significant byte changes.</p>

The sole difference is that a console application always spawns a console if it isn't started from one (or the console is actively suppressed on startup). A windows application, on the other hand, does not spawn a console. It <em>can</em> still attach to an existant console or create a new one using <code>AllocConsole</code>.

This makes Windows applications better suited for GUI applications or background applications because you usually don't want to have a terminal window created for those.

On a more technical note, the only difference between a Console and a Windows executable is <em>one byte</em> in the PE header of the <code>exe</code> file. Toggling this byte manually (e.g. using a hex editor) converts the application type. This is a well-published hack that is used to create console applications in VB6 (where this type of application was not explicitly supported).

To determine and change the subsystem type of an application, you need to read parts of the PE header. The address of the subsystem data is not fixed though, because it's part of the optional file header whose position is determined by an address stored in the DOS file header (in the member <code>e_lfanew</code>). This address actually points to the <code>_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS</code> record which, in turn, includes the <code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32</code> structure.

<p>Besides the difference mentioned by Konrad, console and Windows applications behave differently when called interactively from the command prompt:</p>

<p>When you start a console application, the command prompt doesn't return until the console application exits.
When you start a windows application, the command returns immediately.</p>

<p>This is not true for batch files; they will always wait until the application exits. (You can always use the <code>start</code> command to start an application without waiting.) </p>

<p>The entry point of console applications is <code>wmain</code> (since Visual studio 2008 IIRC), <code>main</code> if you opt out of Unicode-by-default. For desktop ones, it's <code>wWinMain</code>/<code>WinMain</code>.</p>

<p>That is not to say that the techniques are otherwise mutually exclusive. Console applications can still use the whole gamut of Win32 API, and desktop ones can use console I/O (but they have to explicitly create a console window first).</p>
